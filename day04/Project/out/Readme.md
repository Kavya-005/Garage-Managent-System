"On the fourth day of learning Raspberry Pi, I developed a basic garage management system. It utilizes OpenCV for image processing and SQLite3 for data storage. The fee calculation mimics highway toll systems by charging based on the vehicleâ€™s duration of stay. The entire project is managed and compiled using a Makefile."
